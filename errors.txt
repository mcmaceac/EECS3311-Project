----Status Messages for Secure Messenger system project-------------
-- The order of error checking on the arguments of input commands 
-- decreases from high precedence at the top to low at the bottom. 
-- Only the first error, in precedence order, is reported 
-- to the user at the output. If the above errors are not present, 
-- then the status message displays as "OK".
-- Each error message starts with the status message "ERROR" (see at1.expected.txt)
-- Please comment at the forum if any error messages are omitted.
